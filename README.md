## Notes App
✍️ A simple yet powerful Notes App built with React and Context API. Demonstrates real-world state management using React’s Context—without external libraries like Redux. 

This project simulates a lightweight note-taking experience similar to Evernote or Google Keep. It’s designed to demonstrate how to use useContext and useReducer effectively to manage application-wide state, while keeping the code clean, modular, and scalable.
